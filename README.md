## Introduction

This project provides a Dockerized version of Squid, a widely-used proxy server. It allows you to quickly set up and deploy a Squid proxy server within a Docker container.

## Features

- Easy deployment using Docker
- Customizable configuration
- Efficient caching for improved performance

## Usage

### 1. Pull the Squid Docker Image

```bash
docker pull prinako/squid
```

### 2. Run Squid Container

```bash
docker run -d --name squid -p 3128:3128 sameersbn/squid
```

Adjust the port mappings and other options according to your requirements.

### 3. Configure Client Devices

Configure your client devices to use the Squid proxy. Update proxy settings with the Squid server's IP address and port (e.g., 3128).

## Monitoring Logs

Monitor Squid logs by attaching to the running container or inspecting the logs:

```bash
docker logs -f squid
```

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

For additional configuration options and customization, refer to the [Squid Documentation](http://www.squid-cache.org/).

## Configuration

You can customize Squid's configuration by mounting a volume with your own configuration file. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name squid -p 3128:3128 -v /path/to/your/squid.conf:/etc/squid/squid.conf prinako/squid
```

Replace `/path/to/your/squid.conf` with the path to your custom Squid configuration file.
